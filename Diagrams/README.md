# Diagrams

This directory contains visual representations of the database schema and design process. These diagrams are useful for understanding the conceptual and actual implementations of the database.


## Contents

-   **`actual_ERD.png`**: The final Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) generated using DBeaver. This diagram reflects the implemented schema in the database.
-   **`schema_design_ERD.jpg`**: A preliminary ERD drawn to conceptualize the database schema based on the original design idea.


## Usage

1.  **`actual_ERD.png`**: Use this diagram to understand the finalized schema as implemented in the database.
    
    -   Generated automatically from the DBeaver tool.
    -   Represents the relationships and attributes of all tables in the database.
2.  **`schema_design_ERD.jpg`**: Use this diagram to trace the evolution of the schema.
    
    -   Hand-drawn based on the initial business idea.
    -   Represents the initial thought process and design before implementation.


## Notes

-   These diagrams are for reference and documentation purposes.
-   Ensure any updates to the schema are reflected in a new version of the `actual_ERD.png` file.
